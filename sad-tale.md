House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Actually, there was one night he decided to take a walk in the forest near where the goologs and pestulas live. These creatures, known for their docile nature unless provoked, can emit sound waves in such a high pitch that dogs can't even hear it. Ned decides what the hell ever, he can do what he wants. Seeing a pestula with its twisted arms and flower patterned skin, enrages him sending him into a fury barrraging the creature with punches. Not a single one lands. Oh yeah, Ned's plastered right now. Of course, the creature screams, to both cause harm, AND to attract help. He doesn't notice it but he slowly....
